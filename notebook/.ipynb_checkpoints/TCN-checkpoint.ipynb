    "# Horoscope generation using Temporal Convolution Networks\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this notebook is to implement a generator of horoscope based on neural networks. \n",
    "\n",
    "More specifically, the architecture used is a Temporal Convolution Network based on the research paper [\"An Empirical Evaluation of Generic Convolutional and Recurrent Networks for Sequence Modeling\"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.01271). This architecture is fully convolutional and can therefore take arbitrary length sequence as inputs. The main idea of the authors of this paper is to increase the perceptive field of each successive layer using [dilated convolution](https://github.com/vdumoulin/conv_arithmetic). \n",
    "\n",
    "The bulk of the code of the TCN has been taken from [the implementation](https://github.com/locuslab/TCN) linked in the article.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data used here are all the horoscopes published [beliefnet.com](beliefnet.com) for the year 2011. \n",
    "\n",
    "The network takes a sequence of `window_size` characters coming from as input and outputs a sequence of `window_size` characters. The target that we use for training is a slice of the horoscope corresponding to the input slid on step to the right, effectively asking the network what should the next character be. "
